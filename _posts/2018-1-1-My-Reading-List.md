This is my reading list of books for business. 

Many of these books come recommended from successful entreprenuers.

Some I have read, and towards the bottom are others that I plan to read.

Please leave a comment with any recommendations for books that I should add to this list.

### Book I have read

* **[Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results](http://amzn.to/2q8v7Ql) - Christina Wodtk**

	*Great read about the OKRs (objectives and key results) workflow philosophy. I recommend this book if you need help acheiving results in both business and personal life. To learn more about OKRs, see [Awesome OKR](https://github.com/domenicosolazzo/awesome-okr).*

* **[Creativity Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration](http://amzn.to/2EtetxN) - Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace**

	*Very interesting read about the birth of Pixar. Focuses on how one can identify invisible obstacles that are sitting in the way of success*

* **[The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers](http://amzn.to/2CC0nK3) - Ben Horowitz**

	*An 'old-school' busniess book from the direct perspective of a CEO that's worked through some very tough times. Recommended for people running a medium to large company and in need of some no-bullshit advice*

* **[Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](http://amzn.to/2ErdYEF) - Peter Thiel and Blake Masters**

	*This book got me excited for the future in general. Thiel straightforward and logical advise about breaking the thought mold. It challenges your current perceptions on how the world of entreprenurship (and the world at large!) works.*

* **[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change](http://amzn.to/2lAuDwK) - Stephen R. Covey**

	*I read this book long ago - but still find it relevant today. This is a back to basics book that everyone should read. It's the first step in understander your own influence in the world, and how it can be leveraged to affect change.*

* **[Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal](http://amzn.to/2C52Prp) - Nick Bilton**

	*An account of the first few tumultuous years of Twitter's growth, told in story format. Put together from several different accounts of the truth, Nick Bilton weaves a tale of backstabbing and power plays as the founders of Twitter fight to maintain control of the beast they created.*

* **[In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives](http://amzn.to/2CmPv63) - Steven Levy**

	*A look into Google, starting at very beginnings of the company. I enjoyed the first half of this book the most, as it dug into the complex, interesting, and sometimes comical issues that they faced in building the first iterations of the Google search engine.*

* **[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019MMUA8S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) - Mark Manson**

	*Not really a business book, but a great read nonetheless. I found it to be a summary of what you should and should not take seriously in life. Mark clearly delineates between being over emphatic and apatheic, and teaches how to find a spot between the two.*

* **[Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future ](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X) - Ashlee Vance**

	*I loved reading this book. It demonstrates Elon Musk's perserverence and aptitude - both of which are at a level that most people can only hope to come close to. The book describes the path Musk has taken from the days of his first start up, through the success of PayPal, and then dives deeply into the intricacies and difficulties in growing Telsa and SpaceX into companies that will likely change the future. To quote a review found on Audible's website: "This book basically exploits your desire to read about extremely competent people, and you'll love it."*


### In the queue

* **[Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most](http://amzn.to/2CzA872) - Douglas Stone**

	*Recommended reading by Auren Hoffman*

* **[The Strategist: Be the Leader Your Business Needs](http://amzn.to/2CrIbFn) - Cynthia Montgomery**

	*In my Amazon Recommended Reading list. This book is of interest to me as someone working at a small company where everyone needs to be a leader in their own way*

* **[Lean Business Planning: Get What You Want From Your Business](http://amzn.to/2qbum96) - Tim Berry**

	*I ran across this title while learning about businiess planning at a nubile level. I haven't had the chance to read yet, but reviews seem promising*


* **[Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion](http://amzn.to/2q8zf2N) - Robert B. Cialdini**

	*An introduction to persuasion. Typically a recommended read for salespeople, I've learned that a successful person needs to know how to sell themselves and their ideas. This book has a wide range of reviews with mostly 5-stars*

* **[Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk](http://amzn.to/2qbu8yP) Peter L. Bernstein** 

	*Another recommended read from Auren Hoffman. See [Aurens full recommended reading list here](http://blog.summation.net/2013/03/my-reading-list.html).*

* **[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams (3rd Edition) ](https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister** 

	*A book on how to maximize succcess and manage people in the world of software development. (To be truthful, I'm about halfway through this book and have not found the will to finish it just yet. It's very dry IMO)*

* **[Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147) Michael Lopp** 

	*From the synopsis I can summarize that this book is a how-to for managing software developers, geared towards people who are already software developers themselves*

* **[Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123) Geoffrey A. Moore** 

	*There's no doubt about it. This book is old. New editions have tried to enter the recent decade but you'll still hear mentions of companies that have been buried for years. The reviews are adamant though. The marketing principles laid our here are as relevant as ever, and is a must read for anyone looking to step up their marketing game.*
